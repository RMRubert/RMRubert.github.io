# About me

Welcome to my blog! My name is Ricardo Montero. Born in Granada, Spain where I lived 23 years and graduated as a Civil Engineer. Since then, I specialised in computational hydraulics and I have been living on several places (France, Switzerland, Germany), nowadays I lived at Swindon, UK working as a hydraulic engineer. You can have more info about my professional path on ![Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ricmonrub/) or my online CV.


# About the blog


This blog was born out of my desire to learn how to create (and experiment with) static web pages. In the past I have had blogs whose content is basically a compendium of notes, notes, thoughts, etc.. Maybe some of you can remember my first blog hosted on MyOpera whose main content was the notes from my university classes.

Like the previous blogs, the kind of content one can expect is similar to what one might find in my "Desktop Notebook". Fortunately, this blog allows you to see the content organized by ![tags]({{ site.baseurl }}/tag/) and without the doodles in the margins (although some of them are pretty cool!). 


# Hobbies

On the artistic side of thing I enjoy drawing and making old style maps. I have origami in my to-do list. I also enjoy coding. And I have been (unsuccessfully) trying to write (in Spanish) some short-stories.

## Drawing

You could see some of my drawings.
