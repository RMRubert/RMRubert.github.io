# About me

Welcome to my blog! My name is Ricardo Montero. Born in Granada, Spain where I lived 23 years and graduated as a Civil Engineer. Since then, I specialised in computational hydraulics and I have been living in several places like France, Switzerland, Germany, and the UK.

Most of my adult life and my career started in Swindon. This town will always keep a warm place in my heart. But life carries on, and due to my profession nowadays I am living in Birmingham!
 You can have more info about my professional path on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ricmonrub/) or [my online CV](/CV.html).


# About the blog

This blog was born out of my desire to learn how to create (and experiment with) static web pages. In the past, I have had blogs whose content is basically a compendium of notes, sketches, thoughts, etc... Those who knew me whilst I was at university might remember my first blog hosted on MyOpera.

Like my other previous blogs, the kind of content one can expect is similar to what one might find in my "Desktop Notebook". Fortunately, this blog allows you to see the content organized by [tags]({{ site.baseurl }}/tag/) and without the doodles in the margins (although some of them are pretty cool!). 

The blog does not have a language, although probably most entries would be in English. It might be that some are in Spanish, especially if I am talking about creative writing.


# Hobbies

On the artistic side of thing I enjoy drawing and making [old style maps]({{ site.baseurl }}/tag/#Maps). I have origami on my to-do list. I also enjoy coding. And I have been (unsuccessfully) trying to write (in Spanish) some short stories.

## Drawing

You could see some of my drawings if I manage to scan them. Unfortunately, due to covid reasons I haven't got access neither to my drawings nor a scanner.
