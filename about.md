Born in 1990 in Granada, Spain. Currently based on Swindon, United Kingdom. Hydraulic Engineer.

### Professional path

I started to work for CH2M (now Jacobs) as an intern during my master and have been working for them as a River Modeller.

### Hobbies

On the artistic side of thing I enjoy drawing and making old style maps. I have origami in my to-do list. I also enjoy coding. And I have been (unsuccessfully) trying to write (in Spanish) some short-stories.

## Drawing

You could see some of my drawings.
