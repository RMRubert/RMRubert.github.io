Those who work with me know that I am a fan of dark themes on applications. However, until today I used to use a different dark scheme for each application/language. Weeks ago I discovered Solarized and fell in love with it, to the point that not only have I changed all my others skins to Solarized but also I have started to create them following Solarized colour scheme.

This blog post is to announce three new UDL (User Defined Languages) with a Dark Solarized scheme for Flood Modeller (IEF) files, TUFLOW (TCF, TGC, TBC) files and Markdown (MD) files.

Check the GitHub repository below if you are interested in downloading them.
